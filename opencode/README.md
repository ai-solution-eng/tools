# OpenCode Web — Multi-User version on HPE Private Cloud AI

Deploy and manage multiple isolated [opencode](https://opencode.ai) coding-agent environments on **HPE Private Cloud AI**. Each user gets their own PVC-backed workspace, and a shared workspace enables team collaboration.

---

## Access & Authentication

The app entry point is `https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}` (protected by platform
SSO). From there you choose how to log in:

- **Continue with SSO** — uses your platform identity. Each distinct SSO
  account gets its own pod.
- **Use a local account** — log in with a username/password that an **admin
  pre-provisioned** for you. (Self-registration is disabled on the login page;
  accounts are created by an admin — see [Admin Console](#admin-console).)

After logging in you are redirected to your personal path
`https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/u-{slug}`, which serves your UI, terminal,
data manager, and previews directly from your own pod. Access is gated by the
signed session cookie issued at login, so each user can only reach their own
pod.

### URL scheme

Everything lives on the single main host; each user's environment is addressed
by its deterministic slug:

| Purpose | URL |
|---|---|
| Login / SSO / Admin | `https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}` |
| Admin console | `https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/__oc_admin` |
| Personal environment | `https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/u-{slug}` |
| Terminal | `.../u-{slug}/terminal` |
| Data Manager | `.../u-{slug}/data_manager` |
| Preview for port `PORT` | `.../u-{slug}/__preview/{PORT}/` |

Previews are auth-gated (same cookie as the rest of the pod). Share them with
someone who can authenticate to that pod.

### DNS

The platform's DNS must resolve the single app host to the Istio ingress
gateway IP:

- `opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}` → the gateway IP

No wildcard is needed — per-user traffic is routed to pods by path, not by
per-user subdomains.

## Admin Console

Admins manage accounts at `https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/__oc_admin`, reached
via the **Admin login** form on the login page (or by navigating directly).
Credentials come from your values file:

```yaml
admin:
  username: admin-user
  password: "admin-password"
```

From the admin console you can:

- **Create user** — add a username/password; the account is provisioned
  immediately (spinner → **ready**). This is the **only** way to create local
  accounts (self-registration is hidden on the login page), so pre-provision
  accounts for a workshop and hand out the credentials.
- **Delete user** — remove the account and all its pods/PVCs.
- **Reset password** — set a new password for a user.
- **Rename** — change a username (recreates the environment under the new name).

For bulk operations the same endpoints are available programmatically — see
`scripts/user_manager.ipynb`. The router additionally exposes
`POST /__oc_admin/api/sessions/clear` (same admin basic-auth): send `{username}`
to clear one user or `{all: true}` / an empty body to clear every user's opencode
chat history. Under the hood the router runs a short-lived cleanup Job that mounts
the user's state PVC and deletes the conversation database (`opencode.db` under
`/var/opencode/data/opencode`; legacy `storage/` subtrees included), then restarts
the user's pod so the running server recreates a fresh, empty database —
conversations are deleted, while workspace files, `opencode.json`/agents/skills
and `auth.json` (model API keys) are preserved, and users stay logged in.
Irreversible.

## Configuration

### opencode.json, Agents & Skills

All configuration lives in `values.yaml`:

| Field | What it defines |
|---|---|
| `opencodeConfig` | The `opencode.json` config (models, providers, MCP servers, permissions) |
| `opencodeSkills` | Skill markdown files seeded into `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| `opencodeAgents` | Agent markdown files seeded into `~/.config/opencode/agents/` |
| `opencode.version` | The opencode npm version to install (e.g. `1.18.11`) |
| `openchamber.version` | The OpenChamber npm version to install (used when `ui.mode: openchamber`) |
| `ui.mode` | `opencode` (default, built-in web UI) or `openchamber` (OpenChamber frontend) |

To switch the version of either opencode or OpenChamber, change the number in `values.yaml` and repackage. The chart `version` (in `Chart.yaml`) is bumped manually per release; `appVersion` tracks the opencode major.minor family.

### UI modes

- **`ui.mode: opencode`** (default) — the built-in `opencode web` UI is served on the app port, exactly as before.
- **`ui.mode: openchamber`** — a headless `opencode serve` runs on `ui.serverPort` (loopback, `127.0.0.1`) and [OpenChamber](https://openchamber.dev) is served on `ui.chamberPort` (default `3000`), connecting to it via `OPENCODE_HOST` / `OPENCODE_SKIP_START`. OpenChamber is npm-installed into the user state volume (no separate runtime needed; it runs on the same Node 22 image). The terminal / data-manager / preview portals are unchanged. Because the opencode server is loopback-only in this mode, its HTTP basic auth is disabled and OpenChamber's own password prompt is turned off — access is gated entirely by the signed session cookie (the in-pod nginx `auth_request` gate), so there is no additional "Unlock OpenChamber" prompt.

These are bundled into a ConfigMap and copied into each user's `~/.config/opencode/` on first start. Users can **edit any of these files directly** inside their environment — a watcher (`opencode_supervisor.mjs`) monitors `opencode.json`, `config.json`, `opencode.jsonc` and the `skills/` / `agents/` directories for changes and automatically restarts the opencode process. Just **refresh the browser** to see changes take effect.

## Warm Pool (instant first launch)

By default, a brand-new user's first launch waits while the router provisions a
per-user Deployment + PVCs and runs a heavy init (`npm install` of opencode,
uv, ttyd, apt packages) — this can take 3–5 minutes.

The router can instead keep a small pool of **already-provisioned, always-ready
user units** so a first-time user's environment is usable in roughly seconds.

```yaml
warmPool:
  enabled: false   # set to true to opt in
  size: 2          # number of always-ready idle user units to maintain
  refreshIntervalSeconds: 15
```

### How it works

- A "warm unit" is the full per-user set — its own Deployment, Service, workspace
  PVC, and **state PVC**. The toolchain (opencode/uv/ttyd/openchamber) is installed
  into the state PVC, so it is built **once** when the unit enters the pool.
- The router runs a background reconcile loop that keeps `size` warm, un-owned
  units at all times (it builds replacements in parallel whenever one is claimed).
  An un-owned unit that stays non-Ready for more than 15 minutes
  (`WARM_STUCK_THRESHOLD_MS`) is recreated so the pool cannot dry up on a broken
  unit.
- **Assignment is warm-first for new users.** On a first launch the router claims
  the lowest-free warm unit — preferring a Ready unit, but it will also claim a
  unit that is still starting (the loading screen then waits for it, the same UX
  as a cold start, without spawning a dedicated pod). Claiming patches the pod
  template to set the user's slug (for preview/ttyd URLs) and records the user as
  the unit's owner. Claims are serialized per-unit, so two concurrent logins can
  never grab the same unit.
- **Rollouts use `Recreate`, not RollingUpdate.** User pods mount RWO PVCs; a
  RollingUpdate surge pod scheduled on a different node would deadlock on a
  Multi-Attach error while the old pod holds the volumes (surfacing as an
  endless loading page on multi-node clusters). Recreate terminates the old pod
  first; the claim downtime is absorbed by the loading screen and the restart
  is fast because the toolchain is already on the state PVC. Existing
  deployments are converged to Recreate automatically by the reconcile loop
  (owner labels preserved).
- **Users who already have a dedicated environment stay on it** (sticky). Their
  data lives in the dedicated PVCs and is not carried over to warm units, so the
  router never moves them. Only users with no existing environment are assigned
  warm units; a dedicated pod is provisioned only when the pool is disabled or
  has nothing claimable (e.g. pool creation failing).
- `size: 0` or `enabled: false` behaves **exactly like before** (on-demand cold
  spin-up; zero idle pods).
- Versions are **not** baked into an image. opencode/OpenChamber remain runtime-
  parameterized, so bumping `opencode.version` / `openchamber.version` in
  `values.yaml` and repackaging still works. Warm units adopt a new version the
  next time they are claimed/re-initialized via the existing template-version
  logic — no image rebuild.

### Tradeoff

Each warm unit is an idle user pod consuming up to the per-user pod limits
(2 cores / 2 Gi, hardcoded in the user template). `warmPool.size` therefore
adds a permanent overhead of `size × those limits`. This is the explicit cost
of instant first launch; keep it `enabled: false` if idle capacity is a
concern.

### Uninstall / `helm uninstall`

A `pre-delete` hook deletes the dynamically-created per-user/warm resources
(which Helm does not own) so the namespace and shared PVC do not hang in
`Terminating`. The hook:

1. **Stops the router first** (deletes the router `Deployment`) so it can no
   longer reconcile/re-create warm units while teardown is running.
2. Deletes the per-user **Deployments, Services, and Leases in parallel**.
3. Waits for their **pods to terminate**, then deletes the per-user **PVCs**
   (PVC deletion must wait for the pods that mount them to unmount first, so
   that step is ordered after the pods).
4. Leaves the Helm-owned shared PVC intact (it carries only `hpe-ezua/*`
   labels, not `opencode-user-managed`).

## Provisioning Loading Screen

While a user's pod is being assigned/provisioned (a cold first launch can take
3–5 minutes for the per-user `npm install`, uv, ttyd, etc.), the router no
longer leaves the browser hanging on a blank page. It returns a **loading
screen** immediately:

- A spinner plus the text **"Setting up your account…"**.
- The page polls the router's `/__oc_setup_status` endpoint every 2 seconds.
- When the pod becomes ready, the page **auto-reloads** and redirects you to
  `/u-{slug}` automatically.
- If provisioning fails or times out, the page swaps to an error state with a
  **Retry** button (the retry clears the failed provisioning attempt and
  starts over).

With a [warm pool](#warm-pool-instant-first-launch) enabled the loading
screen appears only briefly during the fast rolling restart of a claimed
warm unit (no reinstall), so it is near-instant.

### Configuration

```yaml
provisioning:
  loadingUI:
    enabled: true                      # set false to restore the original blocking behavior
    heading: "Setting up your account…"
    subtext: "This usually takes a few minutes on first launch. Please wait."
```

- `enabled: false` reverts the router to its previous behavior (the request
  blocks until the pod is ready and no loading page is shown).
- The heading and subtext are the messages shown on the loading screen.
- The status/reset endpoint is the reserved router path `/__oc_setup_status`;
  it is handled by the router itself (never proxied to the user pod) and
  requires no ready pod.

## Workspaces

HPE Private Cloud AI provides PVC-backed persistent storage:

| Mount point | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/workspace/personal` | `ReadWriteOnce` PVC | **Personal workspace** — private to each user |
| `/workspace/shared` | `ReadWriteMany` PVC | **Team collaboration** — all users share this space |

Every user gets their own personal PVC (sized via `storage.workspaceSize`) and state PVC (`storage.stateSize`). The shared PVC (`storage.sharedSize`) is populated with initial content from the `shared/` directory at deploy time.

---

## Demo Content

Pre-seeded demos help you get started immediately.

### Personal workspace (`/workspace/personal/`)

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `README.html` | Interactive landing page with copy-paste tutorials for three use cases: Basic Web App (confetti button), Intermediate Web App (coin flip), and Advanced Agentic Workflow (financial advisor with stock research, email draft, feedback). Also lists available MCP tools and provides quick-start instructions. |
| `README.md` | Markdown version of the same demo guide and use-case walkthroughs. Alternative to the html file.|

Each tutorial ends with a `create-server.sh` command to launch a preview server and get a shareable URL.

### Shared workspace (`/workspace/shared/`)

| Directory | Tech | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `toy-web/` | Static HTML/CSS | Simple web page — no dependencies, run with `python3 -m http.server` |
| `toy-gradio/` | Gradio | Interactive ML/demo UI — run with the shared venv |
| `toy-streamlit/` | Streamlit | Data app dashboard — run with the shared venv |
| `toy-uvicorn/` | FastAPI + Uvicorn | REST API backend — run with the shared venv |

A shared Python virtual environment (`/workspace/shared/.venv-preview/`) and `requirements.txt` are provided so you can install dependencies once and run any of the Python-based demos.

---

## Terminal

The built-in opencode web terminal can be unreliable in this environment, with text leaking across terminals. To address this, a dedicated **tabbed, multi-terminal UI** (built on ttyd + tmux) is served at:

```
https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/u-{slug}/terminal
```

It is always available and gives you **multiple independent terminal tabs**, each with the same environment as the opencode agent. Run `opencode` in one tab, `python` in another, and `vim` in a third — they are fully isolated subprocesses.

### Tab model

- **`+`** opens a new terminal tab (a fresh, independent subprocess).
- **Closing the browser tab / reloading the page** only *detaches* — each terminal keeps running in an independent tmux session.
- Reopening `/terminal` lists your still-running terminals and re-attaches them, so you pick up where you left off from your last session.
- **`✕`** on a tab *destroys* it: the subprocess is terminated and the terminal is freed (it will not reappear on reload).
- Terminals persist for the lifetime of your running pod (they are not restored across a pod restart).

---

## Data Manager

A web-based file manager is served at:

```
https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/u-{slug}/data_manager
```

It provides a full UI for navigating, uploading, downloading, and editing files across the **Personal**, **Shared**, and **Config** (`~/.config`) roots:

- **Browse** — Folder tree with breadcrumb navigation across **Personal**, **Shared**, and **Config** (`~/.config`) roots. Hidden dotfiles (`.config`, `.git`, `.bashrc`, …) are shown in all roots.
- **Upload** — Drag-and-drop or click-to-select file upload into any folder.
- **Download** — Single files download directly (with optional rename); multiple files or folders are archived as ZIP or TAR.GZ with a custom filename.
- **Edit** — Double-click any text file to open it in the Monaco editor (VS Code's editor engine) with syntax highlighting and save support. Binary or large files show metadata with a download option.
- **CRUD** — Create folders, create files, rename/move, and delete (recursive for directories).
- **Storage Status** — A collapsible panel shows real-time PVC usage (bytes + inodes) for Personal, Shared, and State volumes, with color-coded usage bars.

The data manager runs as a zero-dependency Node.js process (`data_manager.mjs`) inside the user pod on port 7682, alongside ttyd and the opencode supervisor. All file operations are path-traversal-protected (clamped to `/workspace/personal`, `/workspace/shared`, and `/var/opencode/home/.config`).

---

## Preview URLs & Port Watcher

A background watcher (`port_watcher.mjs`) polls `/proc/net/tcp` every 3 seconds. When any process listens on a port in the 3000–9999 range (excluding reserved ports), the watcher:

1. Generates a public preview URL: `https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/u-{slug}/__preview/{port}/`
2. Prints the URL directly to the terminal (and all PTY sessions)
3. Writes it to a state file for querying via the `preview-url` helper

The platform's routing layer — the router proxy (`/u-{slug}` + the in-pod
nginx) — forwards traffic to the correct local port.

### Quick start a preview server

```bash
/workspace/create-server.sh /workspace/personal/my-file.html 8000
# → [preview] Preview available for port 8000: https://opencode.{DOMAIN_NAME}/u-abc123def456/__preview/8000/
```

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# List active preview ports
preview-url

# Get URL for a specific port
preview-url 8000

# Launch a static file server
/workspace/create-server.sh <file-or-dir> <port>
```

### Key files inside the user environment
